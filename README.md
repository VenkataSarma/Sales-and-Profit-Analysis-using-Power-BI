# Comprehensive Sales and Profit Analysis Using Power BI for a Retail Superstore

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a comprehensive sales and profit analysis dashboard using Power BI for a retail superstore. The analysis provides insights into the store's performance across different regions, sub-categories, states, and years. The data visualization aids in understanding sales trends, identifying profitable areas, and making informed business decisions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is titled **"Sample - Superstore.xls"**. It contains sales records from a retail superstore, including information on:
- Sales
- Profit
- Quantity
- Region
- State
- Category
- Sub-Category
- Year

## Key Insights from the Dashboard
The dashboard created in Power BI includes the following key insights:

1. **Sum of Sales by Sub-Category and Region**
   - Visualizes the total sales amount for each sub-category across different regions (Central, East, South, West).
   - Helps identify which sub-categories are performing well in specific regions.

2. **Count of Sub-Category by Region**
   - A pie chart that displays the distribution of different sub-categories across various regions.
   - Provides a quick view of how product sub-categories are spread across the country.

3. **Sum of Sales by Region, Year, Sub-Category**
   - Displays the sales trends over different years, broken down by region and sub-category.
   - Helps analyze how sales have evolved over time in each region.

4. **KPI: Total Sales**
   - A key performance indicator (KPI) that shows the total sales generated by the store.
   - Provides a quick summary of overall sales performance.

5. **Sum of Sales and Profit by State, Category, Region**
   - A detailed breakdown of sales and profit by state, category, and region.
   - Helps in identifying the most profitable states and categories.

## Tools Used
- **Power BI**: Used for data visualization and creating the dashboard.
- **Excel**: The dataset was stored in Excel format, which was imported into Power BI for analysis.
